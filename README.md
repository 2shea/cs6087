# MIT CS 6.087 "Practical Programming in C"

After going through the courseware a couple of times, I found enough things
about the slides that I wish were covered better or differently. Additionally,
some of the information (such as adoption of C99 and any discussion of C11) is
outdated, and the code formatting on some slides is unfortunate. This
repository contains my rework of the lecture slides, homework, etc.

The slides are compiled using [Landslide][1].
